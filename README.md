# Hello-world

Hi humans (and maybe AI's?),

I am Lexi and I am just starting out with programming. Currently experimenting with different languages before I fully commit to one. Gotta find the right language for me <3. 

My first few projects (and repo's) will be what I have done from my Udacity courses and anything I played around with while doing the courses.
